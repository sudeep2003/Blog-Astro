# Blog Website by Astro🚀

Welcome to this Blog Website, trying to building a stunning blog website built with Astro and styled with Tailwind CSS. This project is designed to showcase the power and flexibility of these technologies in creating a modern and responsive online shopping experience.

## ✨Status

Still working on this project! Adding features, theme and styles! Check back soon for updates.

## 🔥Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of this Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├──layouts/
│   ├──styles/
│   │  └── global.css
│   ├──scripts/
│   └── pages/
│       ├── posts/
│       ├── tags/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
